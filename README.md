# Temperate Blanket Project (Front)
Built off of my friend's base java app for Heroku (check him out: https://github.com/liester).

Inspired by a friend's temperature blanket, where you stitch/knit/crochet a line into a blanket each day with the color based on the average temperature.  The goal is to have a fun way to visualize a "blanket" in the browswer based on historical weather data pulled in from an API.
